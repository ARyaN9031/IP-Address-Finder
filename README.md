 We will utilize the Splay Tree data structure to construct a tree containing the IP addresses of devices linked to a particular network router within its nodes. Our code establishes a connection of 11 devices to the network router, resulting in a shared segment in the IP address of all devices. Subsequently, when the router receives a specific packet from the network and forwards it to a particular device, a lookup operation is employed to locate the correct IP address. To expedite this process, we employ a Splay-Tree for searching and inserting IP addresses, as it is the swiftest data structure for search operations. Consequently, when multiple devices are connected, the router transmits the packet to the designated IP address.
